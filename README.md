# Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

This project contains  all the necessary tasks for the Handwriting Recognition (MNIST).

I Have developed a fully-connected neural network in C++ for the recognition
of the handwritten digits found in the MNIST dataset. I have successfully implemented the neural network.

* build.sh: Contains all necessary code to prepare/build my executable(s).
* read_dataset_images.sh: Successfully checks if I can read in, convert, and write an MNIST dataset image to a file.
* read_dataset_labels.sh: Successfully checks if I can read in and write an MNIST dataset label to a file.
* mnist.sh: Successfully triggers the training and testing of my neural network implementation.
